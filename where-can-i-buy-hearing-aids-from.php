                                        <p>Numerous items can be purchased cheaply online. If you have a minor hearing loss, you may be tempted to purchase a personal sound amplification product (PSAP), often known as “hearing amplifiers” or “hearing aid amplifiers,” from an online retailer. This device is comparable to “cheater” eyeglasses sold in local pharmacies. However, hearing loss associated with ageing is more complicated than age-related vision loss.</p>
                                        <p>These inexpensive items tend to amplify all sounds, not simply those that are inaudible. Online companies may offer tutorials on how to clean and utilise their products, but nothing is customised. At a hearing clinic, your hearing aids are customised to your exact hearing loss and any additional conditions you may have, such as tinnitus. Each individual needs distinct adjustments and counselling on an ongoing basis. Many consumers need specific ear tips, which aren’t available online. Clinics can also pre-program your hearing aids to change settings based on the environment. In addition, if your services are bundled, you can return whenever necessary for cleanings or adjustments.</p>

                                        <p>The majority of well-known hearing aid clinics are owned by hearing aid manufacturers or have close ties to them. Like many other sectors, they are attempting vertical integration by establishing their own storefronts to sell directly to consumers. While other large international retailers have begun selling re branded store-specific hearing aids that can only be programmed in-store.</p>
                                        <p><span>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</span> distinguishes between healthy competition that supports fair prices and competition that local independents just cannot afford. Large scale international corporations are able to sell their products at a lesser price due to their purchasing power. Local businesses are unable to compete and are forced to close their doors.</p>
                                        <p>Consequently, this is a major issue for local Australian firms. However, the problem does not end there. For patients with hearing loss, reduced prices come at a price.</p>
